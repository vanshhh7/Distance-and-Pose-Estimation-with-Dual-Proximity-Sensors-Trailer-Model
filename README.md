# Distance-and-Pose-Estimation-with-Dual-Proximity-Sensors-Trailer-Model
This project simulates a robot with dual proximity sensors and a trailer to estimate distance traveled and pose. The robot moves forward, senses wheel velocity with noise, updates its position, and adjusts the trailerâ€™s pose. Errors in estimation are analyzed, and results are visualized using trajectory and error plots.
